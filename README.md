        <div class="user card ">
          <div class="card-top">
            <div class="title-img">
```
```css
.proud-of-this-css {
    background-color: hsl(246, 80%, 60%);
      height: 55%;
      padding: 3%;
      border-radius: 8px;
      display: flex;}
```
```js
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
function changeValues(state) {}
}
```
